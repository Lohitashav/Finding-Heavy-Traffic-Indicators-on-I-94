# Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94
This project analyzes traffic data from the westbound I-94 Interstate Highway to uncover key indicators of heavy traffic. The analysis explores factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week to determine their influence on traffic volume.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset, provided by John Hogue, is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 48,204 rows and 9 columns, with no missing values. Each row represents traffic and weather data for a specific hour, spanning from 2012-10-02 09:00:00 to 2018-09-30 23:00:00.

The traffic data was recorded at a station located midway between Minneapolis and Saint Paul. This analysis specifically focuses on westbound traffic in this region and does not generalize results for the entire I-94 highway.

# Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to identify patterns and indicators of heavy traffic, such as:

- Seasonal variations (e.g., summer vs. winter).
- Weather conditions (e.g., snow, rain, clear skies).
- Time-based trends (e.g., peak hours, weekdays vs. weekends).

# Features of the Dataset
- Time-based attributes: Date and time information for each observation.
- Traffic volume: The number of cars westbound on I-94.
- Weather data: Conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and weather descriptions.

# Tools and Techniques
The analysis leverages Python and key data analysis libraries such as:

- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- Statistical analysis to uncover trends and relationships.

# Outcomes
This project aims to provide actionable insights into traffic behavior, which can help in traffic management, urban planning, and optimizing transportation systems.
